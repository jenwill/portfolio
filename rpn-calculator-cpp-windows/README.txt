Academic Project, CS 133, Spring 2014

# Summary:

This console calculator uses post-fix notation instead of in-fix notation--that is, operations are written after the numbers operated on. This was the third individual project in my CS 133 class.

# Project Highlights:

    Unit Test wasn’t a requirement for the assingment, however, I decided to learn and use Microsoft’s C++ Unit Testing Framework.

# Development Environment:

    Windows 8
    Visual Studio 2012
    C++
    Microsoft C++ Unit Testing Framework

# Building Instructions

You can build the project by opening the solution file in Visual Studio (The project was created and tested in Visual Studio 2012)
