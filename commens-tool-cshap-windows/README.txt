Personal Project, Spring 2014

# Summary:

For my C++ classes I was required to write comments for every method, file, and class in my projects. 
This is an example of the format I was expected to write:

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Class: EQueue
// method: EQueue(size_t,T) 
// description: Constructor with elements
// Input: None 
// Output: None 
// Calls:
// DCList::DCList();
// Called By: n/a 
// Parameters: size_t n_elements -- number of elements
// T datum -- initial value
// Returns: n/a
// History Log:
// 05/16/14 VS completed version 1.0
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a few projects I decided to write a tool to ease the documentation process.
