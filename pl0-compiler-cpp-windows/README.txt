Pl/0 Compiler
Academic Project, Compilers, Fall 2011

#Summary:

This compiler was the final assignment in Compilers class I took in the fifth and final year of my bachelor's degree. It's coded and C++, 
and it is designed to parse a compile a modified version of Pl/0 which includes a case statement. The project is designed to interface with a 
IDE (developed by another student) in order to run the complied code.

The original assignment required C, but I was granted a special permission to develop the compiler in C++ after showing proficiency in the 
language, and with the understanding that I was entirely responsible of any problem during development (since the university didn't include C++ 
in the computer science degree) . The project obtained a 10/10 score.

The source code for this program is entirely in spanish due to the nature of its development. i.e. It was developed for a Computer Science 
Class in a Spanish-speaking country.

# Project Highlights:

    STL usage.
    Class architecture was developed from scratch.

# Development Environment:

    Windows 7
    Visual Studio 2010
    C++

# Building Instructions

The solution file has been converted to Visual Studio's 2012 format in order to be able to de opened and compiled in said version without problems.
