Personal Project , Winter, Spring and Summer 2013

# Summary:

Since my C++ formal education didn't include graphical user interface development, 
I decided to learn and practice the Qt UI library in conjunction with C++. 
One of my main objectives was to attempt a non-trivial project that forced me to learn 
and understand the intricacies of complex C++ UI programming. I decided to develop a simple tile-map editor.
