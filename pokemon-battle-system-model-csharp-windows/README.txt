Pokemon Battle System Model

Independent Project, Winter and Spring 2014

# Summary:

In order to practice C#, my software engineering skills, and my object-oriented analysis and design techniques, 
I decided to model the classes and algorithms of a well-known video-game: Pokemon Red/Blue.

The system was developed as an encapsulated .NET library capable of simulated simplified Pokemon combats 
(i.e. only a subset of 10 Pokemons were initially modeled), and was heavily tested using Test Driven Development and a Unity3D application.

# Project Highlights:

    Defensive approach using assertions and Test Driven Development
    Logging system encompassing development messages and error messages.
    Use of designpatternsandOOAD techniques
        Observer Pattern
        Factory Pattern
        Singleton
    XML queries using Linq
    System architecture and classes designed from scratch

# Development Environment:

    Windows 8
    Visual Studio 2012
    Mysql Database (withMysql Workbench)
        The database was exported to XML files in order to be loaded by the dll
    NUnit
    C#

# Building Instructions

You can build the project by opening the solution file in Visual Studio (The project was created and tested in Visual Studio 2012)
