# Vladimir Sanchez Programming Portfolio

Here you'll find the source code of my best personal and academic programming projects. Inside every folder there is a readme file with information about the project and building instructions.

Also, remember to check a prettier description of the projects at: http://vladimirsan.com/programming-portfolio/
