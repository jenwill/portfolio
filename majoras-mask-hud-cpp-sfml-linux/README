Personal Project, Winter 2011

#Summary:

After studying C++ with the book "Thinking in C++", I decided to work on a project that would help me put in practice all I've learned.  
At that time, I had just finished playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and I thought it would be challenging to simulate 
the mathematics and algorithms the in-game clock showcased.

#Project Highlights:

I used this project in order to practice several technologies and development strategies I had been learning on my own and couldn't properly practice:

    Test Driven Development (Using CXX TEST)
    MVC Design Pattern
    Vim Tex Editor

All of the previous items were self-taught.

#Development Environment:

    Ubuntu 10.10
    SFML 1.6
    G++ Compiler with Makefiles
    C++

#Build Instructions

The included makefile contains rules for building the main application and for building the unit testing code, however, 
it is important to link the SFML version 1.6 and to install all its pre-requisites.
